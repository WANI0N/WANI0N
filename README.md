### Hi there, I'm Marek ðŸ‘‹

*I started working in Western Union in 2016 and after a year started developing a program for automating [business rule analysis](https://www.progress.com/faqs/corticon-faqs/what-is-a-business-rules-engine), narrative production and internal/external investigation during my free time. After my efficency went up to 500%, the application was adapted by the company and I was promoted to deploy it as a platform and manage it full time. Later I was given a team to manage and became teamleader. The main feature of the platform is that changes can be made and published without entering the code. The application expanded to multiple offices around the world and has designated ticketing platform, automated tests and APIs.*

*I received an award from CEO for this project:*
